# 🚆 FindMyTrain Java Application

**FindMyTrain** is a Java-based console application that simulates a simplified train tracking system. It allows users to search for trains, platforms, schedules, and station information, making it a great learning project for object-oriented programming and Java collections.

## 💡 Features

- 🚉 Add and manage stations
- 🚂 Add and manage trains with their schedules
- 🗓️ Assign platforms and train timings
- 🔍 Search functionality to find trains by time or station
- 🧱 Object-oriented architecture with modular classes

## 📁 Project Structure

- `FindMyTrainApp.java` — Main class for user interaction and system testing.
- `TrainSystem.java` — Core controller class that manages trains, stations, platforms, and schedules.
- `Train.java` — Data model representing a train.
- `Station.java` — Represents a train station.
- `Platform.java` — Represents a platform at a station.
- `Schedule.java` — Represents train arrival and departure times at stations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Core Java
- Java Collections Framework
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## 🚀 How to Run

1. The repository:

   ```bash
   [https://github.com/sonisubham2701/FindMyTrain.git
   cd FindMyTrain](https://github.com/sonisubham2701/core--java-project/tree/57b342b3a1de36860e1ae311fa248ab39d423f48#-how-to-run)

2.Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

3.Run the main application:

java FindMyTrainApp

📌 Sample Use Cases

Add new stations and trains dynamically.
Assign platforms and manage train schedules.
Search for trains arriving or departing from specific stations.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
Solid grasp of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance)
Use of Java Collections like ArrayList and HashMap
Designing real-world systems in Java
